         <h4>attribute</h4>

         <li>HTML attributes are special words used inside the opening tag to control the element's behaviour. HTML attributes are a modifier of an HTML element type. An attribute either modifies the default functionality of an element type or provides functionality to certain element types unable to function correctly without them. In HTML syntax, an attribute is added to an HTML start tag.</li>

         <br>

         <h4>Element</h4>

         <li>An HTML element is a type of HTML (HyperText Markup Language) document component, one of several types of HTML nodes (there are also text nodes, comment nodes and others).[vague] The first used version of HTML was written by Tim Berners-Lee in 1993 and there have since been many versions of HTML. The most commonly used version is HTML 4.01, which became official standard in December 1999. An HTML document is composed of a tree of simple HTML nodes, such as text nodes, and HTML elements, which add semantics and formatting to parts of document (e.g., make text bold, organize it into paragraphs, lists and tables, or embed hyperlinks and images). Each element can have HTML attributes specified. Elements can also have content, including other elements and text.</li>
        
         <br>

         <h4>Comment</h4>

         <li>The comment tag is used to insert comments in the source code. Comments are not displayed in the browsers.

          You can use comments to explain your code, which can help you when you edit the source code at a later date. This is especially useful if you have a lot of code.</li>
       
          <br>

          <h4>Form</h4>

          <li>An HTML form is used to collect user input. The user input is most often sent to a server for processing, The form element is a container for different types of input elements, such as: text fields, checkboxes, radio buttons, submit buttons, etc.</li>
        
        <br>

        <h4>Links</h4>

        <li>Links are found in nearly all web pages. Links allow users to click their way from page to page, The most important attribute of the a element is the href attribute, which indicates the link's destination.</li>
       
        <br>

        <h4>Paragraph</h4>

        <li>
          The p HTML element represents a paragraph. Paragraphs are usually represented in visual media as blocks of text separated from adjacent blocks by blank lines and/or first-line indentation, but HTML paragraphs can be any structural grouping of related content, such as images or form fields</li>
